{"name":"data-structures","tagline":"Common data structures for the go (golang) programming language.","body":"# Go Data Structures\r\n\r\nby Tim Henderson (tim.tadh@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013, Licensed under the GPL version 2. Please reach out to me\r\ndirectly if you require another licensing option. I am willing to work with you.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nTo collect many important data structures for usage in go programs. Golang's\r\nstandard library lacks many useful and important structures. This library\r\nattempts to fill the gap. I have implemented data-structure's as I have needed\r\nthem. If there is a missing structure or even just a missing (or incorrect)\r\nmethod open an issue, send a pull request, or send an email patch.\r\n\r\nThe library also provides generic types to allow the user to swap out various\r\ndata structures transparently. The interfaces provide operation for adding,\r\nremoving, retrieving objects from collections as well as iterating over the\r\ncollection using functional iterators.\r\n\r\nFinally, the tree sub-package provides a variety of generic tree traversals. The\r\ntree traversals and other iterators in the package use a functional iteration\r\ntechnique [detailed on my blog](\r\nhttp://hackthology.com/functional-iteration-in-go.html).\r\n\r\nI hope you find my library useful. If you are using it drop me a line I would\r\nlove to hear about it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
